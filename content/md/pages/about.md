Hey, Fellow Stranger ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to My Personal Corner of the Internet ðŸ˜€

### Who is this??

Iâ€™m **Sawan Sancheti** â€” a software engineer by trade, a curious mind by nature, and a forever student of this wonderfully weird world of computing.

### A bit of overview of myself

Iâ€™m a backend engineer based in Bengaluru, India, working with distributed systems and microservices. Most of my work revolves around languages like Python, Kotlin, and Java, but Iâ€™ve also been down the rabbit holes of Clojure, Erlang VM, some Rust nowadays; and even Haskell/Agda when the math itch kicks in.

I first got into computer science during high school, and that curiosity has only deepened over time. These days, Iâ€™m especially fascinated by the relationship between computer science and mathematics â€” from type theory and proof assistants to functional programming and homotopy type theory (yep, itâ€™s a thing and itâ€™s beautiful).

When Iâ€™m not geeking out over compilers or distributed databases, youâ€™ll probably find me walking or hiking somewhere quiet, reading philosophy, or playing tennis.

### What is this place??

This site is a space for me to:

- Explore ideas Iâ€™m learning or wrestling with
- Share thoughts on programming languages, system design, and mathematical foundations of CS
- Document my journey â€” both as a software engineer and as a thinker trying to understand this craft more deeply

---

## ðŸ§­ What You'll Find Here

- **My Bio** â€“ a bit about me, what I do, and how I got here
- **Blog Posts** â€“ deep dives, brain dumps, analogies, code experiments, and the occasional meme-laced explanation of complex topics
- **Learning Notes** â€“ documenting my journey through the craft of software engineering (aka: me trying to figure things out and writing them down before I forget)

> ðŸ’¬ Curious about monads, dependent types, proof assistants, or why category theory keeps showing up in code?  
> Stick around â€” Iâ€™ll be writing about all that and more.

Whether youâ€™re here to learn something new, share thoughts, or just poke around, Iâ€™m glad you stopped by ðŸ‘‹ðŸ˜„
