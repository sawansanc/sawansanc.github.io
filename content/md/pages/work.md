## 💼 Past Employment

Welcome to the part of this website where things start to get serious (and seriously fun).

### 🧊 Rippling – Software Engineer II *(Sep 2024 – Present, Bengaluru)*

 At Rippling—a rocketship of a startup making HRIS less of a headache—I led from the front.

- I took the reins on core HR modules that thousands of companies depend on to hire and onboard new folks—yeah, I helped make that magic happen.
- Worked across the stack and across teams (product, design, you name it) to ship features that actually made a difference.
- Refactored gnarly old code into sleek, scalable features using Django and MongoDB. Tech debt, consider yourself handled.
- Jumped into the on-call chaos, wrestled bugs in prod, and led postmortems like a true incident whisperer.
- Mentored newer devs like a proud tech-uncle—think design reviews, pair programming, and delivery bootcamps.

### 💸 Jupiter – Software Development Engineer II *(Mar 2023 – Sep 2024, Bengaluru)*

Fintech? Check. Engineering at scale? Check. I was part of the core team building out Jupiter’s lending platform—because who said money can’t be fun?

- Took ownership from 0 → 🚀 for multiple services in the loans platform—think clean architecture and clean commits.
- Played the architect role and rewired the lending stack with scalable patterns and seriously rigorous reviews.
- Introduced property-based testing before it was cool (and made it team-wide standard).
- Balancing innovation with pragmatism, I made sure we shipped reliably while keeping code quality A+.

### 💳 Jupiter – Software Development Engineer I *(Aug 2021 – Mar 2023, Bengaluru)*

This was where the real engineering bootcamp began. Think of it as my tour of duty in high-stakes systems.

- Built production-grade services that crunched over a million transactions daily—auto-pay, card swipes, and EMI logic included.
- Mapped complex credit products into elegant, maintainable services—like translating banker-speak into code.
- Tackled performance bottlenecks and squashed long-standing bugs, while juggling on-call like a zen master.

### 🚌 Shuttl – Software Engineer *(Apr 2021 – Aug 2021, Bengaluru)*

Brief but impactful—like a power nap that fixes your whole day.

- Took major services from Flask to FastAPI and watched our platform go *vroom* 🚀 in both performance and scalability.
- Cut through layers of tech debt and cleaned up core microservices like spring cleaning on steroids.

### 🌐 Nagarro – Associate Software Engineer *(Jan 2020 – Mar 2021, Gurugram)*

My first *real* gig. Here’s where I learned to build systems that don’t fall over—and to ask clients smart questions.

- Built a GraphQL-based CMS that served content faster than you could say "REST who?"
- Designed a self-balancing directory structure because someone had to tame that content chaos.
- Played with AWS AppSync + Lambda like Lego blocks—only cooler.
- Wrote an IAM system for the CMS because access control isn’t optional, it’s sacred.
- Also dabbled in Clojure and Neo4j for PoCs that became legit projects. Nerdy? Absolutely. Worth it? Every bit.

### 🔬 AGH University of Science and Technology – Research Intern *(Jun 2019 – Jul 2019, Krakow)*

Two words: nerd paradise. I dove head-first into social network analysis and machine learning.

- Scraped global news, built datasets, and let unsupervised ML loose on international relations.
- Visualized data like a pro using Gephi and Jupyter. If it looked good and made sense, I probably built it.
