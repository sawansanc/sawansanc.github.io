### 🛠️ What do I do?

I'm a backend engineer based in Bengaluru, India. My day-to-day involves working with distributed systems and microservices. I primarily work with Python, Kotlin, and Java — but I’ve also explored Clojure, the Erlang VM, Rust (recently), and occasionally dive into Haskell, Agda, or Rocq when the math itch strikes.

My journey into computer science began in high school and has only deepened since. These days, I’m especially interested in the intersection of mathematics and computer science — particularly type theory, proof assistants, functional programming, and homotopy type theory.

### 🗺️ What is this site?

Right now, it’s a personal profile. Eventually, I plan to use this space for:

- Technical blogs
- Ideas and brain dumps
- Code experiments
- Notes from my learning journey
